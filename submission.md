# Project 5 — Mixtape Bug Hunt · Submission

## AI Usage

I used an AI assistant (Claude, via Claude Code) throughout this project. Its role and my
verification are described honestly below.

**Where AI helped — codebase navigation & orientation.** I asked the assistant to summarize each
service module's responsibility and to trace two call chains end to end (rating a song; viewing a
playlist). This accelerated building the codebase map: instead of reading all four route files and
five service files cold, I had the assistant produce a first-pass map of "route → service → model"
for every endpoint, then I read the code to confirm each claim.

**Where AI helped — bug triage.** For each reported issue I asked the assistant to point at the
suspicious function and explain what it does. This was fastest for the mechanical bugs
(`weekday() != 6`, the `[:-1]` slice) where the defect is visible once you're looking at the right
line.

**Where I verified / overrode the AI.** I did **not** take any diagnosis on faith. Every root cause
was confirmed by running code:
- I ran the existing test suite to establish a baseline (3 failing, 10 passing) before touching
  anything — this immediately confirmed #1 (streak) and #5 (playlist) and, crucially, showed the
  search duplicate tests **passing**.
- For **Issue #3 (search duplicates)** the AI initially described it as a live duplicate bug. I
  disproved that by probing the database directly: the raw SQL join returns 3 rows for a 3-tag song,
  but `db.session.query(Song).all()` returns 1 because SQLAlchemy's ORM deduplicates entities by
  primary key. So the reported symptom does not reproduce as written — it is a *latent* defect. I
  documented and fixed it on that basis rather than claiming a reproduction I never got. This is the
  clearest example of where reading and running the code myself corrected the AI's first answer.
- For **Issue #2 (feed window)** the AI could identify the 24-hour constant but not the "correct"
  value — that was a product-semantics judgment I made by reading the seed data's own definition of
  recent activity ("the past 30 minutes").

In short: AI was a fast navigator and explainer for code I then verified myself; it was unreliable
as a diagnostician until I confirmed each claim by executing the code.

## Codebase Map

**Architecture.** Mixtape is a Flask + SQLAlchemy app with a strict two-layer separation:

```
HTTP request → routes/*.py   (parse input, format JSON, map ValueError → HTTP status)
             → services/*.py  (ALL business logic and orchestration)
             → models.py      (SQLAlchemy ORM) → SQLite (instance/mixtape.db)
```

Every route delegates immediately to a service function and contains no business logic of its own.
This is the dominant pattern in the code, and it is why all five bugs live in `services/` — the
routes are thin pass-throughs.

**Main files and their roles:**

- **`app.py`** — application factory (`create_app`) and the shared `db = SQLAlchemy()` instance.
  Registers four blueprints under `/songs`, `/playlists`, `/users`, `/feed`.
- **`models.py`** — five entity models plus association tables:
  - `User` — carries streak state directly on the row (`listening_streak`, `last_listened_at`).
  - `Song` — `shared_by` FK points at the original sharer (the person notified about the song).
  - `Tag` + `song_tags` (association table) — songs have a many-to-many set of tags (0, 1, or 3+).
  - `Rating` — score 1–5, with a `UniqueConstraint(user_id, song_id)`: one rating per user per song.
  - `ListeningEvent` — one row per listen; the source of truth for both streaks and the feed.
  - `Playlist` + `playlist_entries` (association table) — **a join table with an explicit
    `position` column**, so song order is stored, not inferred from insertion. It also records
    `added_by` and `added_at`.
  - `Notification` — `user_id` is the recipient; has a `notification_type`, `body`, and `read` flag.
- **`routes/`** — `songs.py` (search / detail / rate / listen), `playlists.py` (create / detail /
  list songs / add song), `users.py` (profile / streak / notifications), `feed.py` (listening-now /
  activity).
- **`services/`** — `streak_service.py`, `feed_service.py`, `search_service.py`,
  `notification_service.py`, `playlist_service.py`. This is where the bugs are.
- **`seed_data.py`** — rebuilds the DB with 5 users, 25 songs (deliberately spanning 0/1/3+ tags),
  3 playlists, and listening events at carefully chosen ages (some minutes old, some hours/days old)
  that encode the *intended* behaviour of the feed and search features.

**Data flow — rating a song (traced end to end):**
`POST /songs/<song_id>/rate` → `routes/songs.py:rate()` parses `user_id` and `score` →
`notification_service.rate_song(user_id, song_id, score)` validates the score, looks up the song and
rater, then **upserts** a `Rating` (updates the existing row if the user already rated the song,
thanks to the unique constraint; otherwise inserts). The route serializes the returned `Rating` to
JSON. (Issue #4 lives here: this flow should also notify the song's sharer, and originally did not.)

**Data flow — viewing a playlist:**
`GET /playlists/<id>/songs` → `routes/playlists.py:get_songs()` →
`playlist_service.get_playlist_songs()` joins `Song` to `playlist_entries`, filters by playlist, and
orders by `playlist_entries.position` (explicit stored order). (Issue #5 lived here.)

**Pattern worth noting:** notifications are created by a single helper, `create_notification`, which
both `add_to_playlist` and (after my fix) `rate_song` call. Comparing which service functions do and
don't call it is exactly how Issue #4 was found.

## Root Cause Analysis

<!-- RCA entries are appended here as each bug is fixed. -->

### Issue #1: My listening streak keeps resetting

- **How you reproduced it:** I ran the existing test suite first (`pytest tests/`) to establish a
  baseline. `tests/test_streaks.py::test_streak_increments_on_sunday` failed with `assert 1 == 2`:
  it listens on Saturday (streak → 1) then Sunday and expects the streak to become 2, but the code
  left it at 1. That test isolates the exact condition — a streak that continues into a Sunday.
- **How you found the root cause:** I followed the streak feature from the route down:
  `POST /songs/<id>/listen` → `routes/songs.py:listen()` → `streak_service.record_listening_event()`
  → `update_listening_streak(user, now)`. Reading `update_listening_streak`, the increment branch was
  `elif days_since_last == 1 and today.weekday() != 6:`. The moment I saw `weekday() != 6` I checked
  what `datetime.weekday()` returns — Monday is 0 and **Sunday is 6** — and it was clear the branch
  deliberately excluded Sundays.
- **The root cause:** `datetime.weekday()` returns `6` for Sunday. The increment branch only ran when
  `days_since_last == 1` **and** `today.weekday() != 6`, so any consecutive-day listen that fell on a
  Sunday skipped the `+= 1` branch and dropped into the `else`, which resets the streak to `1`. There
  is no legitimate reason for a streak to reset on Sundays; the weekday clause was simply wrong.
- **Your fix and side-effect check:** I removed the `and today.weekday() != 6` clause so the branch is
  just `elif days_since_last == 1:` and added a comment explaining why (consecutive days always
  increment). Side-effect check: I re-ran all of `tests/test_streaks.py` — the new-user (streak = 1),
  same-day (no double count), and skipped-day (reset to 1) cases all still pass, so the fix corrects
  the Sunday case without weakening the reset/increment logic on other days. 5 passed.

### Issue #5: The last song in a playlist never shows up

- **How you reproduced it:** In the baseline test run,
  `tests/test_playlists.py::test_playlist_returns_all_songs` failed (a 5-song playlist returned 4)
  and `test_playlist_returns_songs_in_order` failed (the list was truncated to `["Track 1" … "Track
  4"]`, missing `"Track 5"`). Both point at the same symptom: whatever is last in position order is
  dropped.
- **How you found the root cause:** I traced `GET /playlists/<id>/songs` →
  `routes/playlists.py:get_songs()` → `playlist_service.get_playlist_songs()`. The query itself was
  correct — it joins `Song` to the `playlist_entries` association table and orders by
  `playlist_entries.position` ascending. The bug was in the very last line: the return statement
  sliced the result with `songs[:-1]`. The function's own docstring says "returns all songs," so the
  slice directly contradicts the stated intent — that mismatch made me confident this was the cause,
  not just a suspicious line.
- **The root cause:** `get_playlist_songs` built the fully-ordered list of songs and then returned
  `[song.to_dict() for song in songs[:-1]]`. The `[:-1]` slice removes the final element, so the last
  song by position is always omitted. (It also had a nastier edge: a single-song playlist would
  return `[]`, since slicing a one-element list with `[:-1]` yields an empty list.)
- **Your fix and side-effect check:** I changed the return to iterate over the full list —
  `[song.to_dict() for song in songs]`. Side-effect check: `test_empty_playlist_returns_empty_list`
  still passes (an empty playlist iterates to `[]` with no error), and the ordering test now passes
  because no element is dropped. The one-song edge case is also implicitly corrected. 3 passed.

### Issue #4: I got notified when a friend added my song to a playlist but not when they rated it

- **How you reproduced it:** There is no route that returns "was a notification created," so I
  reproduced it at the service level. I wrote a test (`tests/test_notifications.py`) that has one user
  rate another user's song via `rate_song`, then queries `Notification` for the sharer. On the
  original code, zero `song_rated` notifications existed — confirming the sharer is never told their
  song was rated. For contrast, the seed data already contains a working `song_added_to_playlist`
  notification, so the playlist path clearly notifies and the rating path clearly does not.
- **How you found the root cause:** The hint said this was architectural, not a typo, so I compared
  the two interaction functions in `notification_service.py` line by line. `add_to_playlist()` ends
  with a guarded `create_notification(...)` call to `song.shared_by`. `rate_song()` performs the
  rating upsert, commits, and returns — with **no** `create_notification` call anywhere. The helper
  and the recipient (`song.shared_by`) were both readily available; the call site was simply absent.
- **The root cause:** `rate_song()` never created a notification. The notification capability exists
  and is used by `add_to_playlist()`, but the rating flow was missing the equivalent call, so rating
  a song produced a `Rating` row and nothing else. This is a missing-step/architectural omission, not
  a wrong value.
- **Your fix and side-effect check:** I added a guarded `create_notification` call at the end of
  `rate_song()`, after the commit, notifying `song.shared_by` with type `song_rated` — mirroring
  `add_to_playlist` exactly, including the `if song.shared_by != user_id` guard so users aren't
  notified about rating their own songs. Side-effect check: I confirmed the rating upsert itself is
  untouched (both the insert and update-existing paths still work), that rating your own song produces
  no notification, and that re-rating (the update path) still fires a notification. New regression
  tests in `tests/test_notifications.py` cover all three cases. 3 passed.

### Issue #2: Friends Listening Now shows people from yesterday

- **How you reproduced it:** I re-seeded the database and probed the events directly. The seed data
  deliberately splits listening events into "recent" (10–20 minutes old, meant to appear) and "older"
  (2h+, meant not to appear). I counted how many events pass each cutoff:
  the current 24-hour window admitted 6 events with ages `[10, 15, 20, 120, 600, 1080]` minutes — i.e.
  it included the 2-hour, 10-hour, and 18-hour events — whereas a 30-minute window admitted only the
  `[10, 15, 20]`-minute events. That directly shows friends from earlier in the day (and yesterday)
  leaking into a feed that is supposed to mean "right now."
- **How you found the root cause:** I traced `GET /feed/<user_id>/listening-now` →
  `routes/feed.py:listening_now()` → `feed_service.get_friends_listening_now()`. The query logic is
  correct: it filters `ListeningEvent.listened_at >= cutoff`, orders by most recent, and dedupes to
  one row per friend. The only suspect was `cutoff = now - RECENT_THRESHOLD`, so I looked at the
  module-level constant: `RECENT_THRESHOLD = timedelta(hours=24)`.
- **The root cause:** The recency window was 24 hours. "Friends Listening Now" is meant to be a
  near-real-time view, but a 24-hour cutoff turns it into a "listened at any point in the last day"
  feed, so anyone who listened earlier today or last night still appears. The filter direction and
  dedup were fine — only the threshold value was wrong.
- **Your fix and side-effect check:** I changed `RECENT_THRESHOLD` to `timedelta(minutes=30)` and
  added a comment explaining the product reasoning. The 30-minute value is a deliberate choice, not an
  arbitrary one: it matches the seed data's own definition of recent activity ("within the past 30
  minutes") and sits cleanly between the 20-minute events that should appear and the 2-hour events
  that should not. Side-effect check: `get_activity_feed` in the same module is intentionally
  *not* recency-filtered (its docstring says so) and I left it untouched; I also confirmed a user with
  no friends still returns `[]`. New regression tests in `tests/test_feed.py` assert a 3-hour-old
  friend is excluded, a 15-minute-old friend is included, per-friend dedup holds, and the no-friends
  case returns empty. 3 passed.

### Issue #3: The same song keeps showing up twice in search

- **How you reproduced it — and the honest result:** I tried to reproduce a user-visible duplicate
  and **could not**, which turned out to be the important finding. The seed data has songs with 3+
  tags precisely to trigger this, so I ran `search_songs("Crown")` (a 3-tag song) — it returned the
  song **once**, and the existing test `test_search_no_duplicates_multi_tag_song` already **passes**.
  To understand why, I compared the raw SQL to the service output: the underlying
  `outerjoin(song_tags)` query returns **3 rows** for that song (one per tag), but
  `db.session.query(Song).all()` returns **1** entity. So the duplicate exists at the row level but
  never reaches the user.
- **How you found the root cause:** I read `search_service.search_songs()` and saw it outer-joins
  `song_tags` with no `.distinct()` — the classic setup for join fan-out. I confirmed the fan-out with
  a direct probe (raw row count = 3 vs entity count = 1). The reason it doesn't surface is that
  SQLAlchemy's ORM **deduplicates mapped entities by primary-key identity** within a result set, so
  the identical `Song` rows collapse to one object before `to_dict()` runs.
- **The root cause:** The query joins `song_tags` even though tags are neither filtered on nor
  selected in this function (tags are loaded separately through the `Song.tags` relationship, which is
  `lazy="subquery"`). That unnecessary join multiplies rows by a song's tag count. Today the ORM's
  identity de-duplication hides it, so it is a **latent** defect rather than a live one — but it would
  immediately produce duplicates the moment anyone switched to a column/`.scalars()` query, added
  `.count()`/pagination, or applied `.distinct()` elsewhere in the chain.
- **Your fix and side-effect check:** I removed the `outerjoin(song_tags)` entirely (and the now-unused
  `Tag`/`song_tags` imports), leaving a plain `WHERE title ILIKE … OR artist ILIKE …`. This removes the
  duplication at its source and expresses the query's real intent. Side-effect check: all five
  `tests/test_search.py` cases still pass (matching, empty result, and the no-duplicate cases for
  0/1/3-tag songs), and I confirmed each result dict still carries its full `tags` list on the seeded
  data (`Crown Heights Anthem` → `['rap', 'hip-hop', 'boom bap']`) — proving tags come from the
  relationship, not the dropped join. 5 passed. *(Note: because the ORM already collapses duplicates,
  the dict-level tests can't distinguish before/after; the guarantee here is the removal of the
  fan-out at the query level, documented in an inline comment.)*
